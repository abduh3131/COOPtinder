# Job Tinder

This project provides a minimal prototype of a Tinder‑style application for job applications. It consists of:

* **backend/** – Flask API using SQLite and OpenRouter for AI features.
* **frontend/** – React Native app (Expo) for iOS.
* **setup.sh** – simple helper script to install dependencies.

The color palette uses green and white similar to TD Bank.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js (for React Native)
* Xcode / iOS simulator for running the mobile app
* An OpenRouter API key set via the environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

## Setup

Run the script to install Python dependencies and Expo CLI:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Ensure Node.js is installed beforehand. The script will prompt if Node.js is missing.

## Running the backend

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
python3 backend/app.py
```

The Flask server will listen on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running the mobile app (iOS)

From the `frontend` directory:

```bash
expo start --ios
```

This will open the Expo dev tools and launch the app in the iOS simulator.

## Usage Overview

1. Launch the backend server.
2. Run the mobile app with Expo.
3. Create an account from the app or via `/register` API.
4. Edit your resume and skills on the account page.
5. Press **Load Job** to receive a job suggestion generated by the AI.
6. Swipe **Yes** or **No**. When swiping yes, your resume is automatically improved for that job in the background.

This repository contains a minimal starting point and can be extended for a full featured application.

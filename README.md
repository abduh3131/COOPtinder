This repository contains **CareerSwipe**, a mobile-first job application built with Next.js.

For a quick start on Windows 11, double-click `start.bat`. The PowerShell script will install Node.js with **winget** if it isn't already available, install project dependencies, prompt for your OpenRouter API key, then launch the development server. If Node needed installing the script adds it to your `PATH` automatically. After a short delay it opens <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. To test on a phone, browse to `http://<your-pc-ip>:3000` while the server is running.

See [`careerswipe-app/`](careerswipe-app/) for the source code and more detailed instructions.

This repository contains **CareerSwipe**, a mobile-first job application built with Next.js.

For a quick start on Windows 11, double-click `start.bat`. The script installs Node.js if needed, sets up the project, launches the dev server, and automatically opens your browser on <http://localhost:3000> after a brief delay. To test on a phone, browse to `http://<your-pc-ip>:3000` while the server is running.

See [`careerswipe-app/`](careerswipe-app/) for the source code and more detailed instructions.

This repository contains **CareerSwipe**, a mobile-first job application built with Next.js.

For a quick start on Windows 11, double-click `start.bat`. If Node.js isn't installed the script uses **winget** to fetch it—run the batch file from an elevated prompt so winget has permission. The script then installs dependencies, prompts for your OpenRouter API key, and launches the dev server. After a brief delay your default browser opens <http://localhost:3000>. You can reach the site from phones on the same Wi‑Fi at `http://<your-pc-ip>:3000` and install it as a PWA from the browser’s install option.

See [`careerswipe-app/`](careerswipe-app/) for the source code and more detailed instructions.

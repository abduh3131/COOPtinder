# Job Tinder

This project provides a minimal prototype of a Tinder‑style application for job applications. It consists of:

* **backend/** – Flask API using SQLite and OpenRouter for AI features.
* **frontend/** – React Native app (Expo) for iOS.
* **setup.sh** – helper script to install dependencies on macOS/Linux.
* **setup.bat** – Windows batch file to install dependencies and start the app.

The color palette uses green and white similar to TD Bank.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js (for React Native)
* Xcode / iOS simulator for running the mobile app
* An OpenRouter API key (the scripts will prompt for it if not set)

## Setup

Run one of the setup scripts to install Python dependencies and Expo CLI.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./setup.sh

# Windows (installs and then starts the app)
setup.bat
```

Ensure Node.js is installed beforehand. The scripts will print a message if it is missing.
On Windows, `setup.bat` will prompt for your OpenRouter API key and then start the app automatically.

## Running everything

On macOS/Linux, run `python3 run_app.py` to start both the backend and the Expo app. It will prompt for your API key if not already set.

```bash
python3 run_app.py
```

This script launches the Flask server in the background and then opens the Expo dev tools, automatically starting the iOS simulator. The Flask server listens on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage Overview

1. On Windows run `setup.bat`; on macOS/Linux run `python3 run_app.py` to launch the backend and Expo dev tools.
2. Create an account from the app or via `/register` API.
3. Edit your resume and skills on the account page.
4. Press **Load Job** to receive a job suggestion generated by the AI.
5. Swipe **Yes** or **No**. When swiping yes, your resume is automatically improved for that job in the background.

This repository contains a minimal starting point and can be extended for a full featured application.

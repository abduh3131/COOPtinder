This repository contains **CareerSwipe**, a mobile-first job application built with Next.js.

For a quick start on Windows 11, double-click `start.bat`. The script installs Node.js if needed, sets up the project, and launches the app.

See [`careerswipe-app/`](careerswipe-app/) for the source code and more detailed instructions.

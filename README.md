# COOPtinder

A minimal demo application showing a Tinder-style job board. Users can sign up by
uploading a resume and then swipe through job postings to apply.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`. Open it in a browser to create
an account and start swiping.

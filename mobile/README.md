# COOPtinder Mobile App

This folder contains a minimal React Native application built with Expo. It allows a user to register or log in, edit their resume, and request AI-generated job recommendations from the companion server.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You need the Expo CLI installed globally to run the app (`npm install -g expo-cli`). The app assumes the backend server is running on `http://localhost:3000`.
